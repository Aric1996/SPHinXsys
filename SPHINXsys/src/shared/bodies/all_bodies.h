 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 * SPHinXsys (pronunciation: s'finksis) is an acronym from Smoothed Particle*
 * Hydrodynamics for industrial compleX systems. It provides C++ APIs for	*
 * physical accurate simulation and aims to model coupled industrial dynamic*
 * systems including fluid, solid, multi-body dynamics and beyond with SPH	*
 * (smoothed particle hydrodynamics), a meshless computational method using	*
 * particle discretization.													*
 *																			*
 * SPHinXsys is partially funded by German Research Foundation				*
 * (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) DFG HU1527/6-1, HU1527/10-1,			*
 *  HU1527/12-1 and Hu1527/12-4												*
